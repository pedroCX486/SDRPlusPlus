# What's the point of this fork?
 
This fork adds custom builds of the RTL-SDR's fork of the Osmocom drivers to better support the RTL-SDR v4 (and some of their other hardware) and the latest commits of SDR++'s main repo.

**Currently only Intel macOS builds are available (they run perfectly with Rosetta 2). When GitHub adds support for M-series Github Actions, we'll make M-series builds available.**
